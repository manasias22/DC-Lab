# CSL801_Distributed Computing Lab
## Lab Objectives:
1 To understand basic underlying concepts of forming distributed systems.

2 To learn the concept of clock Synchronization

3 To learn Election Algorithm.

4 To explore mutual exclusion algorithms and deadlock handling in the distributed system

5 To study resource allocation and management.

6 To understand the Distributed File System
## Lab Outcomes: At the end of the course, the students will be able to 1

2.Implement techniques for clock synchronization. 

3.Implement techniques for Election Algorithms.

4.Demonstrate mutual exclusion algorithms and deadlock handling. 

5.Implement techniques of resource and process management. 

6.Describe the concepts of distributed File Systems with some case studies.
